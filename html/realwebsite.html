            <h1>(15 book shelves for enchant table setup) - best enchants for every tool and item and armor</h1>
            <p>first pickaxe- silk touch, mending, unbreaking 3, efficiency 5</p>
            <p>second pickaxe- fortune 3, mending, unbreaking 3, efficiency 5</p>
            <p>Axe- efficiency 5, mending, unbreaking 3</p>
            <p>first shovel- efficiency 5, mending, unbreaking 3</p>
            <p>second shovel- efficiency 5, silk touch, mending, unbreaking 3</p>
            <p>fishing rod- luck of the sea 3, lure 3, mending, unbreaking 3</p>
            <p>shield- mending, unbreaking 3</p>
            <p>Protection IV – All armor pieces should have this enchant. Each level o                                        f this enchant adds a 4% reduction in damage. For example, Protection II adds 8% (Level 2 * 4%) damage reduction, and Protection IV adds 16% (Level 4 * 4%) damage reduction. If all four of your armor pieces have Protection IV, you will take 64% less damage.
                Mending – Automatically repairs your armor using experience orbs. For example, killing a zombie would drop XP orbs and automatically repair your armor (at a rate of 2 durability per 1 xp). This enchant is very useful, and can only be obtained from finding a mending enchant book (dungeon chests, fishing, trading, etc). You can’t enchant mending using an enchanting table.
                Unbreaking III – Armor lasts longer before breaking from durability. At level III unbreaking, each armor piece will last about 40% longer before breaking or needing repairs.
                Notes on other enchants:
                
                It is possible to replace Protection IV with other damage reducing enchants, but they are only helpful in specific situations whereas Protection IV is helpful in all situations.
                Thorns III is an enchant that damages attackers. It makes your armor break more quickly, so it is not worth using in most cases.</p>
